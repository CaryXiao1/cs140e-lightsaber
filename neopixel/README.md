## Controlling a  WS2812B light string.

***NOTE: the comment for `t0h` is incorrect: you call `write_1` for
`t0h` and `t1h`, and `write_0` for `t0l` and `t0h`. ***

Today you'll write the code to control a WS2812B light string.
The WS2812B is fairly common, fairly cheap.  Each pixel has 8-bits of
color (red-green-blue) and you can turn on individual lights in the array.

Each light strip has an input direction and an output direction (look
at the arrows).  You can attach multiple in series by connecting the
output of the first one to the input of the second.  They can be cut
into pieces, connected, etc.

The WS2812B's are a good example of how to communicate information
using time.  One way to communicate things fancier than on/off is to use
a fancier protocol (e.g., I2C, SPI).  Another is to just use delays ---
if you have good resolution (low variance, precise control over time and
ability to measure it), each nanosecond of delay can signify information.
The WS2812B's use a crude variant of this.

The WS2812B protocol to send a bit of information:
  1. To send a `1` bit: write a `1` for `T1H` nanoseconds (defined in datasheet), then a `0`
     for T0L nanoseconds.
  2. To send a `0` bit: write a `1` for `T0H` nanoseconds, then a `0` for `T0L` nanoseconds.
  3. To send a byte: send the 7th bit (as above), the 6th, the 5th...
  4. The timings are fairly tight.  The datasheet states +/- 150 nanoseconds.  Thus
     you will have to write your code very carefully.  You will also have to be 
     smart about measuring it --- your measurements take time and will pollute the 
     times you measure.

The protocol to set N pixels:
  1. There will be some number of pixels on each light string.  (You can count them.)
  2. Each pixel needs 3 bytes of information (G, R, B --- in that order) for the 
     color.
  3. Send each byte using the protocol above.
  4. The first 3 bytes you send will get claimed by the first pixel, the second 3
     bytes by the second, etc.

### Notes.

Common mistakes:
  1. for the inlined GPIO routines make sure you use `volatile` pointers.
  2. When writing to the neopixel array, make sure you discard any out of
     bound pixel values.
  3. If you're not getting fairly tight timings, make sure all you are doing
     is writing to the GPIO address --- no if-statement sanity checking,
     division, calling into `GET32` or `PUT32`.
  4. When you reset the neopixel buffer make sure any pixel that was not
     written to is cleared, otherwise each pixel will remain set to the last
     value written to it.

### Check-in

I wish I had time to rewrite the lab, it currently gives too much
starter code, which I think can actually occlude some of the stuff.
If you want to Daniel style and write all the code from scratch, the
interface is pretty small.  You'll just need to put your code in the
`WS2812b.h` header.    `code-daniel` should have everything setup.

If you're lazier, you'll implement several pieces of code:

  0. Get `labs/float-example` to run so you have floating point.
     You'll need to define the `CS240LX_2023_PATH` variable.

  1. Timing routines in `code/WS2812.h`.  These should pass the timing
     tests run by `0-timing-check`.   Since part of this class is
     learning to use datasheets, *please* only use the datasheet we have
     (in `doc/`) and the comments in the given code, don't use blog
     posts, etc.

  2. The simple interface in `neopixel.c` which
     wraps the code you wrote in (1) into a simple interface.  Optimize
     the timings as far as you can and have the code still work.
     The program `2-neopix.c` should work as expected.

  3. Do something novel/cute with the light using your interface.
     For example, hook it up to your accel and gyro.  Or use the remote
     control to control it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Timing weirdness.

We care about nanosecond timings.  At this level, small changes in code
can lead to noticeable impacts.  One confusing timing bug we had for
awhile was related to instruction alignment --- a timed block of code
that was 16 byte aligned took less time than a non-16-byte aligned block.
If you run the code in `weird-timings` you can verify this yourself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  First step: hook up your hardware.

I went through and soldered / shrink wrapped / tested the neopixels
last night.  Hopefully, they are still in working order when you get them.

To hook up the light strings, the female wires should be:
  - Red for power: 3v only!
  - Green or black for ground.
  - White for signal (GPIO pin 21).

Bootload the `staff-binaries/2-neopix.bin` and make sure it sends some
pixels around the light strip.

Note: A confusing thing is that the power for the WS2812B must be pretty
close to the power used to drive the data pin.  For long light strings
you'd want to power them with a external power supply --- however this
will require you either use a "level shifter" to raise the power used
by the pi to signal (since its pins are 3.3v for output) or a transistor
to connect/disconnect the pi 5v to the signal wire of the LED.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 0: implement the timing routines  (30 minutes)

The header `code/WS2812b.h` defines routines to call to write a 0, write a 1,
write a pixel to the light array.  It also defines timing constants.
You should fill thees in using the datasheet and comments.  When you
are done, they should pass the timing checks called by `code/0-timing-check.c`.

These routines will look similar to the timing routines you built
for the sonar lab, with the change that they use the cycle counter
(`cycle_cnt_read()`) rather than the microsecond timer.  
   1. First implement `delay_ncycles` (`WS2812B.h`) and make sure the initial 
      timing checks in `0-timing-check.c` succeed.

   2. Then implement `t1h`, `t0h`, `t1l` and `t0l` making sure each passes.

For `t1h`, `t0h`, `t1l` and `t0l` you will need to replace `0` with the
needed nanosecond in the timings in `WS2812B.h`:

        // to send a 1: set pin high for T1H ns, then low for T1L ns.
        T1H = ns_to_cycles(0),        // Width of a 1 bit in ns
        T0H = ns_to_cycles(0),        // Width of a 0 bit in ns
        // to send a 0: set pin high for T0H ns, then low for T0L ns.
        T1L = ns_to_cycles(0),        // Width of a 1 bit in ns
        T0L = ns_to_cycles(0),        // Width of a 0 bit in ns

You will also need to implement inlined versions of your `gpio_set_on`
and `gpio_set_off` (also defined in `WS2812B.h`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: turn on one pixel (5 minutes)

As a "hello world" you should call your code to turn on one pixel to
a specific color.  Make sure `1-blink.c` works with your code and then
test your understanding by changing it to turn on different colors and
different pixels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3: build the neopixel interface (20 minutes)

The files `neopixel.h` and `neopixel.c` define some trivial routines to add
buffering the a light string.  Finish implementing these (should be fast)
and verify the supplied cursor routine in `2-neopix.c` does something.

  1. `neopix_write`: if the position passed in (`pos`) is out of bounds,
     just return.
  2. `neopix_flush`: write out the pixel values in the array, do a flush.
     Only then set the array to all 0s.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 4: do something cute with the interface.

A lot of people have gotten a lot of free trips and other things because
they were able to do tricks with light strips.   Try to come up with
something cute using you code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Extensions

To make it more interesting:
  1. Trim as many nanoseconds off of the timings as possible and see that the 
     code still works.
